# js-workday-scheduler
## Description
My task was to write a Javascript scheduling application that allows users to save objectives in timeblocks for every hour numbered from 9AM to 5PM given starter code. The requirements were: 

* Display the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down
 
* Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed
 
* Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock

* Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock

* Persist events between refreshes of a page

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
* Go to the deployed URL: https://heyilll.github.io/js-workday-scheduler/
* Click the save icon to save text in each timeblock
